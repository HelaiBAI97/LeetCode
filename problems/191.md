# Description

Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and return the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the [Hamming weight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight)).

**Example 1**:

<pre><code>
<b>Input</b>: 00000000000000000000000000001011
<b>Output</b>: 3
<b>Explanation</b>: The input binary string <b>00000000000000000000000000001011</b> has a total of three '1' bits.
</code></pre>

**Example 2**:

<pre><code>
<b>Input</b>: 00000000000000000000000010000000
<b>Output</b>: 1
<b>Explanation</b>: The input binary string <b>00000000000000000000000010000000</b> has a total of one '1' bit.
</code></pre>

**Example 3**:

<pre><code>
<b>Input</b>: 11111111111111111111111111111101
<b>Output</b>: 31
<b>Explanation</b>: The input binary string <b>11111111111111111111111111111101</b> has a total of thirty one '1' bits.
</code></pre>

**Note**:

- Note that in some languages such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, the input will be given as signed integer type and should not affect your implementation, as the internal binary representation of the integer is the same whether it is signed or unsigned.
- In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using [2's complement notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement). Therefore, in **Example 3** above the input represents the signed integer `-3`.

# Solution

## 1. Bit Manipulation

With bit manipulations, we can check whether the last bit of the binary number is 1 by `n & 1`, and move the binary number one bit right to get the next bit by `n >> 1`.

**Python**
```python
class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        while n:
            if n & 1:
                count += 1
            n >>= 1
        return count
```

**Time Complexity** : $O(1)$ ($O(\log{n})$ in terms of bit)

**Space Complexity** :$O(1)$

## 2. Bit Manipulation - Trick

Ref: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/

A trick of bit manipulation is that we can flip the **last-significant 1** to 0 by `n & (n-1)`.

e.g. 
- `00000100001(1)00` n
- `00000100001(0)11` n-1
- `00000100001(0)00` n & (n-1)

**Python**
```python
class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        while n:
            count += 1
            n &= (n-1)
        return count
```

**Time Complexity** : $O(1)$ ($O(M)$ number of '1's in terms of bit, $\log{n}$)

**Space Complexity** :$O(1)$

## 3. String Operation

We convert the binary number into binary string, then count the character '1' in the string.

**Python 1**
```python
class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        return bin(n).count('1')
```
**Python 2**
```python
class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        return sum([int(i) for i in bin(n)[2:]])
```
**Python 3**
```python
class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        return len([int(i) for i in bin(n) if i == '1'])
```

**Time Complexity** : $O(1)$ ($O(\log{n})$ in terms of bit)

**Space Complexity** :$O(1)$ ($O(\log{n})$ in terms of bit)
