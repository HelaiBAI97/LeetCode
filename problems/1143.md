# 1143. Longest Common Subsequence

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/

# Description

Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return the length of their longest common subsequence.

A *subsequence* of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters(can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters. (eg, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not). A *common subsequence* of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

**Example 1**:

<pre><code>
<b>Input</b>: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
<b>Output</b>: 3
<b>Explanation</b>: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
</code></pre>

**Example 2**:

<pre><code>
<b>Input</b>: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
<b>Output</b>: 3
<b>Explanation</b>: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
</code></pre>

**Example 3**:

<pre><code>
<b>Input</b>: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
<b>Output</b>: 0
<b>Explanation</b>: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
</code></pre>

Constraints:

- `1 <= text1.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= text2.length <= 1000`
- The input strings consist of lowercase English characters only.

# Solution

## 1. Dynamic Programming

DP[i][j]: length of longest common subsequene of text1[:i] and text2[:j]

Choice: if a character in or out the common subsequence.

If text1[i] == text2[j]: then the character in the common subsequence, DP[i][j] = DP[i-1][j-1] + 1

Else: the two characters not both in the current common subsequence, same as before, check next, DP[i][j] = max(DP[i-1][j], DP[i][j-1])

**Python 1**
```python
class Solution:
    def longestCommonSubsequence(self, text1: str, text2: str) -> int:
        DP = [[0 for _ in range(len(text2)+1)] for _ in range(len(text1)+1)]
        
        # base case
        # DP[0][] = DP[][0] = 0
        
        for i in range(1, len(text1)+1):
            for j in range(1, len(text2)+1):
                if text1[i-1] == text2[j-1]:
                    DP[i][j] = DP[i-1][j-1]+1
                else:
                    DP[i][j] = max(DP[i-1][j], DP[i][j-1])
        return DP[-1][-1]
```

**Python 2**
```python
class Solution:
    def longestCommonSubsequence(self, text1: str, text2: str) -> int:
        DP1 = [0 for _ in range(len(text2)+1)]
        DP2 = DP1[:]
        
        for i in range(1, len(text1)+1):
            for j in range(1, len(text2)+1):
                if text1[i-1] == text2[j-1]:
                    DP2[j] = DP1[j-1]+1
                else:
                    DP2[j] = max(DP1[j], DP2[j-1])
            
            DP1 = DP2[:]
        return DP1[-1]
```
