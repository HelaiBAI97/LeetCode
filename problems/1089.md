# 1089. Duplicate Zeros

https://leetcode.com/problems/duplicate-zeros/

---

# Description

Given a fixed length array `arr` of integers, duplicate each occurrence of zero, shifting the remaining elements to the right.

Note that elements beyond the length of the original array are not written.

Do the above modifications to the input array **in place**, do not return anything from your function.

**Example 1**:

<pre><code>
<b>Input</b>: [1,0,2,3,0,4,5,0]
<b>Output</b>: null
<b>Expanation</b>: After calling your function, the <b>input</b> array is modified to: [1,0,0,2,3,0,0,4]
</code></pre>

**Example 2**:

<pre><code>
<b>Input</b>: [1,2,3]
<b>Output</b>: null
<b>Expanation</b>: After calling your function, the <b>input</b> array is modified to: [1,2,3]
</code></pre>

**Note**:

- `1 <= arr.length <= 10000`
- `0 <= arr[i] <= 9`

# Solution

## 1. Naive Approach

Shift rest elements one step right if meet 0s.

**Python**
```python
class Solution:
    def duplicateZeros(self, arr: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify arr in-place instead.
        """
        i = 0
        while i < len(arr):
            if arr[i] == 0:
                # shift
                j = len(arr)-1
                while j > i:
                    arr[j] = arr[j-1]
                    j -= 1
                arr[j] = 0
                i += 1
            i += 1
```

        last = length_ - possible_dups

        # Copy zero twice, and non zero once.
