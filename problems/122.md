# 122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/

---

# Description

Say you have an array `prices` for which the $i^{\text{th}}$ element is the price of a given stock on day $i$.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

**Note**: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1**:

<pre><code>
<b>Input</b>: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
<b>Output</b>: 7
<b>Expanation</b>: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
</code></pre>

**Example 2**:

<pre><code>
<b>Input</b>: [1,2,3,4,5]
<b>Output</b>: 4
<b>Expanation</b>: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
</code></pre>

**Example 3**:

<pre><code>
<b>Input</b>: [7,6,4,3,1]
<b>Output</b>: 0
<b>Expanation</b>: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
</code></pre>

**Constraints**:

- `1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 10 ^ 4`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10 ^ 4`

# Solution

## 1. Dynamic Programming

State: price of each day. Choice: the day to buy and sell. DP[i]: maximal profit at day i.

DP[i] = DP[i-1] + max(0, prices[i] - prices[i-1])

**Python**
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        DP = [0] * len(prices)
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            DP[i] = DP[i-1] + max(0, prices[i] - prices[i-1])
        return DP[-1]
```

**Time Complexity** : $O(n)$

**Space Complexity** :$O(n)$

## 2. One Pass

The maximal profit of multiple transactions is the accummulation of all positive distance between previous day and the current day. 

**Python**
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        profit = 0
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            if prices[i] > prices[i-1]:
                profit += prices[i] - prices[i-1]
        return profit
```

**Time Complexity** : $O(n)$

**Space Complexity** :$O(1)$
