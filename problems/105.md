# 105. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal

https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-preorder-and-inorder-traversal/

---

# Description

Given preorder and inorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.

**Note**:<br>
You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.

For example, given
<pre><code>
preorder = [3,9,20,15,7]
inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]
</code></pre>
Return the following binary tree:
<pre><code>
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
</code></pre>

# Solution

## 1. Recursion Divide

As the preorder is (root->left->right), we know that the root comes before all child, which means the first element of preorder is the root of the entire binary tree. Also, we know left child tree comes before right child tree. As the inorder is (left->root->right), we know that the left child tree comes before the root.

Hence we can determine the nodes of left child tree and right child tree by dividing the inorder string with the root node (first element in preorder). 

Therefore, it's easy to apply recursion and split the left and right child tree.

**Python**
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def buildTree(self, preorder: List[int], inorder: List[int]) -> TreeNode:
        
        if not preorder: return
        
        i = inorder.index(preorder[0])
            
        left = self.buildTree(preorder[1:i+1], inorder[:i])
        right = self.buildTree(preorder[i+1:], inorder[i+1:])
                
        return TreeNode(preorder[0], left, right)
```

**Time Complexity** : $O(n^2)$ (can be improved to $O(n)$)

$O(n)$ recursions. $O(n)$ for searching index of preorder[0]. -> $O(n^2)$

To improve the Time Complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$, we can decrease the indeices searching time to $O(1)$ by establish an index map in advance.

**Space Complexity** :$O(n^2)$ (can be improved to $O(n)$)

The code has actually larger Space Complexity than $O(n)$, but it's easy to achieve by passing the indeices instead of passing the substrings.

## 2. Recursion Imporve

In order to improve the Time and Space Complexities to $O(n)$, instead of a index map with $O(n)$ extra space, we can pass the stop number along the inorder and pop the visited subtree out from the inorder.
