# 142. Linked List Cycle II

https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/

---

# Description

Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return `null`.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer `pos` which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If `pos` is `-1`, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

**Note**: Do not modify the linked list.

**Example 1**:

<pre><code>
<b>Input</b>: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
<b>Output</b>: tail connects to node index 1
<b>Expanation</b>: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
</code></pre>

**Example 2**:

<pre><code>
<b>Input</b>: head = [1,2], pos = 0
<b>Output</b>: tail connects to node index 0
<b>Expanation</b>: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
</code></pre>

**Example 3**:

<pre><code>
<b>Input</b>: head = [1], pos = -1
<b>Output</b>: no cycle
<b>Expanation</b>: There is no cycle in the linked list.
</code></pre>

# Solution

## 1. Hash Set

Maintaining a hash set to record the nodes that visited before.

**Python**
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def detectCycle(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        # Hash Set
        visited = set()
        node = head
        while node:
            if node in visited:
                return node
            visited.add(node)
            node = node.next
        return None
```

At the first round, define two runners starting at head node. For each turn, the fast runner moves two nodes forward and the slow runner moves one node forward. If there is a cycle in the node list, two runners will eventually meet at a point in the cycle.

Denote point A as the head node, point B as the start node of cycle and point C is the node that two runners firstly meet. Denote c as the Length of the cycle.

Then, when the two runners firstly meet each other, the slow runner moved $S_1 = AB + BC + n_1c$, and the fast runner moved $S_2 = AB + BC + n_2c$, where $nc$ represents $n$ ($n \geq 1$) cycles. 

Recall that the fast runner moves two times faster than the slow runner, we have $S_1 = S_2 - S_1 = (n_2-n_1)c$, which is constant times of $c$. In addition, $S_2 = 2S_1 = 2(n_2-n_1)c$, which is also constant times of $c$. 

Then we go to the second round. At this time, we let the slow runner continue, and let another slow (one step forward) runner start at the head node. When the new slow runner reaches point B (start point of cycle), the distance is $S_3 = AB$, which is also the distance of another slow runner $S_2'$. At this point, after entering the cycle, the first slow runner has moved $S_2' + BC + n_2c = S_1 = (n_2-n_1)c$, which is constant times of cycle length. Hence, the first slow runner also locates at point B. 

Proof done.

**Python**
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def detectCycle(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        # Two Pointers
        fast, slow = head, head
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
            if fast == slow:
                slow2 = head
                while slow != slow2:
                    slow = slow.next
                    slow2 = slow2.next
                return slow
```
