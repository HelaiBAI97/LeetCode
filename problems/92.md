# 92. Reverse Linked List II

https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list-ii/

---

# Description

Reverse a linked list from position *m* to *n*. Do it in one-pass.

**Note**: 1 ≤ *m* ≤ *n* ≤ length of list.

**Example**:

<pre><code>
<b>Input</b>: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL, m = 2, n = 4
<b>Output</b>: 1->4->3->2->5->NULL
</code></pre>

# Solution

## 1. Recursively

With recursively method, we traverse the node list from tail to head. For each recursion, if in reversing, return the newHead and newTail of the reversed part.

**Python**
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverseBetween(self, head: ListNode, m: int, n: int) -> ListNode:
        # recur
        
        # if n == 1, means no need to reverse
        if n == 1: return head
        
        if m == 0: # designed m=0, represent currently in reversing. n' = n-m+1, return newHead and newTail of the reversed part.
            if n == 2: # if n-m == 1, no need to reverse
                return head, head
            else: # if n-m>1, current node is the newTail, newHead remains.
                newHead, newTail = self.reverseBetween(head.next, 0, n-1)
                newTail.next, head.next = head, newTail.next
                return newHead, head
        elif m == 1: # if m == 1, reverse begin. Current node is the newTail, newHead remains.
            newHead, newTail = self.reverseBetween(head.next, m-1, n)
            newTail.next, head.next = head, newTail.next
            return newHead
        else:   # if m > 1, reverse not begin.
            newHead = self.reverseBetween(head.next, m-1, n-1)
            head.next = newHead
            return head
```

**Time Complexity** : $O(n)$

**Space Complexity** :$O(n)$
        
## 2. Iteratively

With iteratively method, we traverse the node list from head to tail. In reversing part, maintaining three pointers refer to the newHead and current nodes and the node after reverse part. Change the current node's next to the newHead and assign the current node to newHead.

**Python**
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverseBetween(self, head: ListNode, m: int, n: int) -> ListNode:
        node = head
        prev = None
        
        for _ in range(m-1):
            prev = node
            node = node.next
        
        # reverse m ot n
        newHead, curr, newEnd = None, node, node
        for _ in range(m, n+1):
            next, curr.next = curr.next, newHead
            newHead, curr = curr, next
        
        node.next = curr
        if prev: 
            prev.next = newHead
            return head
        else:
            return newHead
```
