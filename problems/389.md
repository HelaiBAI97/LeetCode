# 389. Find the Difference

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference/

# Description

Given two strings **s** and **t** which consist of only lowercase letters.

String **t** is generated by random shuffling string **s** and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in **t**.

**Example**:

<pre><code>
Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.
</code></pre>

# Solution

## 1. Dictionary of Appearance Count

Establish a dictionary to count the appearance of each character in array `s`. Iterating over `t`, minus the appearance of the characters in `t`, then we can get the new character if not appeared or remaining appearance equals to 0.

**Python**
```python
class Solution:
    def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        # HashSet
        Hash = {}
        for c in s:
            Hash[c] = Hash.get(c, 0) + 1
        for c in t:
            if Hash.get(c, 0) == 0:
                return c
            else:
                Hash[c] -= 1
```

**Time Complexity** : $O(2n)$

**Space Complexity** :$O(n)$

## 2. Using `ord` and `chr`

Convert the characters into ascii numbers, minus the sum of `t` with sum of `s`, then we get the ascii number of the new character. Convert it back to char type.

**Python**
```python
class Solution:
    def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        # ord
        ans = sum([ord(c) for c in t])
        ans = ans - sum([ord(c) for c in s])
        return chr(ans)
```

**Time Complexity** : $O(2n)$

**Space Complexity** :$O(1)$

## 3. XOR

According to the fact that two number with same amount has XOR result 0, we can apply XOR operations with array `s` and `t` by converting them into ascii numbers, the XOR result is the remaining ascii number, which appears not in pairs.

**Python**
```python
class Solution:
    def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        ans = 0
        for c in (s+t):
            ans ^= ord(c)
        return chr(ans)
```

**Time Complexity** : $O(n)$

**Space Complexity** :$O(1)$
