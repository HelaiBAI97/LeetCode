# Description

Given a string, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.

**Example 1**:

> **Input**: "abcabcbb"
> 
> **Output**: 3 
> 
> **Explanation**: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 

**Example 2**:

> **Input**: "bbbbb"
> 
> **Output**: 1
> 
> **Explanation**: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

**Example 3**:

> **Input**: "pwwkew"
> 
> **Output**: 3
> 
> **Explanation**: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
> 
>              Note that the answer must be a **substring**, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

# Solution

## Brute Force

Check all substring candidates and find the longest one without duplicate character.

**Time Complexity** : $O(n^3)$

**Space Complexity** : $O(n)$ / $O(1)$

## Sliding Window

The longest substring without repeating characters is the shortest substring over the substrings between each pair of repeating characters.

Maintaining a "substring" for the current substring and a "max_length" for the maximun length of the substring. 

Traverse the entrie string. 

For each new character, if there exist another same character, drop all characters before and including this character and append the character to the end of the substring. 

**Python**
```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        
        if len(s) <= 1:
            return len(s)
        
        substring, max_len = s[0], 1
        
        for char in s[1:]:
            for cid, c in enumerate(substring):
                if char == c:
                    max_len = max(max_len, len(substring))
                    substring = substring[cid+1:]
                    break
                    
            substring += char
        
        max_len = max(max_len, len(substring))
        
        return max_len
```

**Time Complexity** : $O(n^2)$

**Space Complexity** : $O(n)$

## Sliding Window with Hash Set

Use a sliding window as the current substring. By maintaining the nonduplicated substring and sliding the boundaries, we can get the longest substring without the duplicate characters.

Use hash set to maintain the non-duplicatable and reduce the seeking time to constant time $O(1)$.

**Python**
```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        
        char_set = set()
        max_len = 0
        
        i,j = 0,0
        
        while i < len(s):
            if s[i] in char_set:
                
                max_len = max(max_len, len(char_set))
                
                char_set.discard(s[j])
                j += 1
            else:
                char_set.add(s[i])
                i += 1
                
            
        max_len = max(max_len, len(char_set))
        
        return max_len
```

**Time Complexity** : $O(2n)$

**Space Complexity** : $O(n)$

## Sliding Window with Index Hash Table

The maximum length of the substring without repeating characters is the minimum length over the lengths of each pair of repeating characters.

Memories all the positions that a character appears and calculate the shortest distance.

Use hash table to reduce the seeking time to constant time $O(1)$.

**Python**
```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        
        substring, max_len = {}, 0
        start = 0
        
        for cid, char in enumerate(s):
            # if exit in substring
            if char in substring and substring[char] >= start:
                max_len = max(max_len, cid - start)
                start = substring[char] + 1
                
            substring[char] = cid
        
        max_len = max(max_len, len(s) - start)
        
        return max_len
```

**Time Complexity** : $O(n)$

**Space Complexity** : $O(n)$
