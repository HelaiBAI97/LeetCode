# 198. House Robber

# Description

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**.

**Example 1**:

<pre><code>
<b>Input</b>: nums = [1,2,3,1]
<b>Output</b>: 4
<b>Expanation</b>: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
</code></pre>

**Example 2**:

<pre><code>
<b>Input</b>: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]
<b>Output</b>: 12
<b>Expanation</b>: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
             Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
</code></pre>

**Constraints**:

- `0 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 400`

# Solution

## 1. Dynamic Programming

Here we use dynamic programming to solve this question. State: house, wealth. Choice: rob house or not.

DP[i]: maximum wealth after visiting house 0 .. i

We know that DP[i] = maximum of (rob) nums[i] + DP[i-2] or (not rob) DP[i-1].

Base case: DP[0] = nums[0]

**Python 1**
```python
class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums: return 0
        DP = [0 for _ in range(len(nums)+1)]
        DP[1] = nums[0]
        
        for i in range(2, len(nums)+1):
            DP[i] = max(nums[i-1]+DP[i-2], DP[i-1])
        return DP[-1]
```

**Python 2**
```python
class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums: return 0
        A, B = 0, nums[0]
        
        for i in range(2, len(nums)+1):
            C = max(nums[i-1]+A, B)
            A, B = B, C
        return B
```

**Time Complexity** : $O(n)$

**Space Complexity** :$O(n)$ (**Python 1**) | $O(1)$ (**Python 2**)
