# 72. Edit Distance

https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/

# Description

Given two words *word1* and *word2*, find the minimum number of operations required to convert *word1* to *word2*.

You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:

- Insert a character
- Delete a character
- Replace a character

**Example 1**:

<pre><code>
<b>Input</b>: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
<b>Output</b>: 3
<b>Explanation</b>: 
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')
</code></pre>

**Example 2**:

<pre><code>
<b>Input</b>: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
<b>Output</b>: 5
<b>Explanation</b>: 
intention -> inention (remove 't')
inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
exection -> execution (insert 'u')
</code></pre>

# Solution

## 1. Bottom Up - Dynamic Programming

Use dynamic programming to solve this question. 

DP[i][j]: edit distance between word1[:i] and word2[:j]

DP[i][j] = 
- If word1[i] == word2[j], do nothing: DP[i-1][j-1]
- Else: Minimum of
    - add i: DP[i-1][j] + 1
    - delete j: DP[i][j-1] + 1
    - replace j by i: DP[i-1][j-1] + 1

**Python 1**
```python
class Solution:
    def minDistance(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
        # DP[i][j]: edit distance between word1[:i] and word2[:j]
        # base case: DP[i][0] = i DP[0][j] = j
        # DP[i][j] = min{
        #               (add i) DP[i-1][j] + 1
        #               (delete j) DP[i][j-1] + 1
        #               (replace j with j) DP[i-1][j-1] + 1
        #               (do nothing if i==j) DP[i-1][j-1]
        word1 = ' '+word1
        word2 = ' '+word2
        DP = [[0 for _ in range(len(word2))] for _ in range(len(word1))]
        for i in range(len(word1)): DP[i][0] = i
        for i in range(len(word2)): DP[0][i] = i
            
        for i in range(1, len(word1)):
            for j in range(1, len(word2)):
                if word1[i] == word2[j]: DP[i][j] = DP[i-1][j-1]
                else:
                    DP[i][j] = min(DP[i-1][j], DP[i][j-1], DP[i-1][j-1]) + 1
        return DP[-1][-1]
```

**Python 2**
```python
class Solution:
    def minDistance(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
        if not word1: return len(word2)
        if not word2: return len(word1)
        DP1 = [i for i in range(len(word2)+1)]
        DP2 = [1] + [0 for i in range(len(word2))]
            
        for i in range(1, len(word1)+1):
            DP2[0] = i
            for j in range(1, len(word2)+1):
                if word1[i-1] == word2[j-1]: DP2[j] = DP1[j-1]
                else:
                    DP2[j] = min(DP1[j], DP2[j-1], DP1[j-1]) + 1
            DP1 = DP2.copy()
        return DP2[-1]
```

**Time Complexity** : $O(M*N)$

$M$: len(word1)
$N$: len(word2)

**Space Complexity** :$O(N)$(**Python 1**) / $O(1)$(**Python 2**)

## 2. Top Down - Use Queue for Early Termination

We could maintain tuple(w1, w2, d) for after d operations to get w1 and w2. Hence, if w1 == w2, we can say their edit distance is d.

We use a queue to place smaller d first for early termination.

**Python**
```python
class Solution:
    def minDistance(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
        queue = [(word1,word2,0)]
        visited = set()
        while queue:
            w1, w2, d = queue[0]
            queue = queue[1:]
            if (w1, w2) not in visited:
                if w1 == w2: return d
                visited.add((w1, w2))
                while w1 and w2 and w1[0] == w2[0]:
                    w1, w2 = w1[1:], w2[1:]
                queue.extend([(w1[1:], w2[1:], d+1), (w1, w2[1:], d+1), (w1[1:], w2, d+1)])
                    
```
