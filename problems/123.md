# 123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III

https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iii/

---

# Description

Say you have an array for which the $i^{\text{th}}$ element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.

**Note**: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1**:

<pre><code>
<b>Input</b>: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
<b>Output</b>: 6
<b>Expanation</b>: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
             Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
</code></pre>

**Example 2**:

<pre><code>
<b>Input</b>: [1,2,3,4,5]
<b>Output</b>: 4
<b>Expanation</b>: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
</code></pre>

**Example 3**:

<pre><code>
<b>Input</b>: [7,6,4,3,1]
<b>Output</b>: 0
<b>Expanation</b>: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
</code></pre>

# Solution

## 1. Dynamic Programming

Ref: https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iii/discuss/135704/Detail-explanation-of-DP-solution

State: price of each day, remaining transactions. Choice: the day to buy and sell. DP[k][i]: maximal profit sell at day i when finishing kth transaction.

Base case: DP[0][0] = 0

DP[k][i] = max((hold) DP[k][i-1], (sell) max_j(profit_when_buy_on_day[j]))

The profit when buy a share on day j and sell on day i is profit on day j-1 plus the price on day i minus the price on day j: DP[k-1, j-1] + prices[i] - prices[j].

**Python 1**
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(prices) <= 1: return 0
        # 1. DP
        max_k = 2
        DP = [[0 for _ in range(len(prices))] for _ in range(max_k+1)]
        for k in range(1, max_k+1):
            min_j = prices[0]
            for i in range(1, len(prices)):
                # sell the share on i-th day then the profit is prices[i] - prices[j] + dp[k-1, j-1] = prices[i] - min_j{prices[j] - dp[k-1, j-1]}
                min_j = min(min_j, prices[i] - DP[k-1][i-1])
                DP[k][i] = max(DP[k][i-1], prices[i] - min_j)
        return DP[-1][-1]
```

**Python 2**
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(prices) <= 1: return 0
        max_k = 2
        min_DP = [prices[0] for _ in range(max_k+1)] 
        DP = [0 for _ in range(max_k+1)]
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            for k in range(1, max_k+1):
                # sell the share on i-th day then the profit is prices[i] - prices[j] + dp[k-1, j-1] = prices[i] - min_j{prices[j] - dp[k-1, j-1]}
                min_DP[k] = min(min_DP[k], prices[i] - DP[k-1])
                DP[k] = max(DP[k], prices[i] - min_DP[k])
        return DP[-1]
```
