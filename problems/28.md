# 28. Implement strStr()

# Description

Implement [strStr()](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/strstr/).

Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or **-1** if needle is not part of haystack.

**Example 1**:

> **Input**: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
> 
> **Output**: 2

**Example 2**:

> **Input**: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"
> 
> **Output**: -1

**Clarification**:

What should we return when `needle` is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when `needle` is an empty string. This is consistent to C's [strstr()](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/strstr/) and Java's [indexOf()](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#indexOf(java.lang.String)).

# Solution

## 1. Brute Force

Choose each character in the haystack string as the start point, try match the neddle with the substring.

**Python**
```python
class Solution:
    def strStr(self, haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:
        for i in range(len(haystack)-len(needle)+1):
            if haystack[i:i+len(needle)] == needle:
                return i
        return -1
```

**Time Complexity** : $O(M*N)$

**Space Complexity** :$O(1)$

$M$: lenth of haystack

$N$: lenth of needle

## 2. KMP Algorithm

Use KMP algorithm to reduce the complexity from $O(M*N)$ to $O(M+N)$. 

KMP algorithm reduce the duplicate calculation by finding the repeat subpatterns. For 'ABCABD' in pattern, if we failed to match 'D', we do not need to restart from the very beginning, but restart from the 'C', because we have already matches 'ABCAB' and the 'AB' is repeated which is no longer need to redo the matching. 

KMP algorithm defines a next array to record the position of last repeat subpattern. `next[j]` means if `string[i] != pattern[j]`, we could update the `j=next[j]` and continue the matching.

**Python**
```python
class Solution:
    def strStr(self, haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:
        # KMP
        def getNext(pattern:str):
            '''
                next[j]: if string[i] != pattern[j], then update j = next[j] and check again.
                next[j] = k if pattern[:,k] == pattern[j-k+1:j] 
                next[j] = -1 if None = pattern[j]
            '''
            next = [-1] * len(pattern)
            j, k = 0, -1
            while j < len(pattern) - 1:
                # if p[j] == p[k], then 
                #      if pattern[j+1]!=pattern[k+1] we have next[j+1] = k + 1
                if k == -1 or pattern[j] == pattern[k]: 
                    k = k + 1
                    j = j + 1
                    if pattern[j] == pattern[k]: # if same, then as string[j+1]!=pattern[k+1] hencd string[j+1]!=pattern[k+1]
                        next[j] = next[k]
                    else:
                        next[j] = k
                else:
                    k = next[k]
            return next
        
        # main
        next = getNext(needle)
        i = j = 0
        while i < len(haystack) and j < len(needle):
            if j == -1 or haystack[i] == needle[j]:
                # 1. if j == -1 then no former match for j, i should increase => i++, j=0
                # 2. if string[i] == pattern[j], match, then check next pair.
                i += 1
                j += 1
            else: # not match, update j = next[j]
                j = next[j]
                
        # check
        if j == len(needle):
            return i-j
        else:
            return -1
