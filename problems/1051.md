# 1051. Height Checker

https://leetcode.com/problems/height-checker/

---

# Description

Students are asked to stand in non-decreasing order of heights for an annual photo.

Return the minimum number of students that must move in order for all students to be standing in non-decreasing order of height.

Notice that when a group of students is selected they can reorder in any possible way between themselves and the non selected students remain on their seats.

**Example 1**:

<pre><code>
<b>Input</b>: heights = [1,1,4,2,1,3]
<b>Output</b>: 3
<b>Expanation</b>: 
Current array : [1,1,4,2,1,3]
Target array  : [1,1,1,2,3,4]
On index 2 (0-based) we have 4 vs 1 so we have to move this student.
On index 4 (0-based) we have 1 vs 3 so we have to move this student.
On index 5 (0-based) we have 3 vs 4 so we have to move this student.
</code></pre>

**Example 2**:

<pre><code>
<b>Input</b>: heights = [5,1,2,3,4]
<b>Output</b>: 5
</code></pre>

**Example 3**:

<pre><code>
<b>Input</b>: heights = [1,2,3,4,5]
<b>Output</b>: 0
</code></pre>

**Constraints**:

- `1 <= heights.length <= 100`
- `1 <= heights[i] <= 100`

# Solution

## 1. Sort

Apply sorting methods to sort the array to get the final correct list. Count the different numbers.

Built-in time sort for generality.

**Python 1**
```python
class Solution:
    def heightChecker(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        corrects = sorted(heights)
        count = 0
        for i, j in zip(corrects, heights):
            if i != j:
                count += 1
        return count
```

Counting sort for $O(n)$ time complexity.

**Python 2**
```python
class Solution:
    def heightChecker(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        # counting sort
        Max = max(heights)+1
        counts = [0]*Max
        for h in heights:
            counts[h] += 1
        corrects = []
        for i in range(len(counts)):
            corrects += [i]*counts[i]
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(heights)):
            if heights[i] != corrects[i]:
                count += 1
        return count
```

**Time Complexity** : $O(n\log{n})$ (**Python 1**) | $O(n)$ (**Python 2**)

**Space Complexity** :$O(n)$
