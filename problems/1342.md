# 1342. Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero

https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-steps-to-reduce-a-number-to-zero/

---

# Description

Given a non-negative integer `num`, return the number of steps to reduce it to zero. If the current number is even, you have to divide it by 2, otherwise, you have to subtract 1 from it.

**Example 1**:

<pre><code>
<b>Input</b>: num = 14
<b>Output</b>: 6
<b>Explanation</b>:
Step 1) 14 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 7. 
Step 2) 7 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 6.
Step 3) 6 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 3. 
Step 4) 3 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 2. 
Step 5) 2 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 1. 
Step 6) 1 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 0.
</code></pre>

**Example 2**:

<pre><code>
<b>Input</b>: num = 8
<b>Output</b>: 4
<b>Explanation</b>:
Step 1) 8 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 4. 
Step 2) 4 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 2. 
Step 3) 2 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 1. 
Step 4) 1 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 0.
</code></pre>

**Example 3**:

<pre><code>
<b>Input</b>: num = 123
<b>Output</b>: 12
</code></pre>

**Constraints**:

- `0 <= num <= 10^6`

# Solution

## 1. Observations

Based on the observatoions that if a number is odd, we need to apply `minus 1` immediately. And if a number is even, `divide by 2` always makes the result smaller than `minus 1`.

**Python**
```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfSteps (self, num: int) -> int:
        steps = 0
        while num:
            if num & 1:
                num -= 1
            else:
                num >>= 1
            steps += 1
        return steps
```

**Space Complexity** :$O(1)$

## 2. Bit Features

This works because each 0 in `bin(num)` represents a place we divide by 2, and each 1 in `bin(num)` represents a place we subtract 1. Each time we subtract 1, we also need to divide by 2 immediately after, so each 1 in `bin(num)` actually requires 2 steps. We subtract 2 at the very end to account for the fact that bin will stick `"0b"` on the front, and for the fact that the last time we subtract 1, we don't divide by 2 because we'll have reached the end.

**Python**
```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfSteps (self, num: int) -> int:
        return bin(num).count("1") * 2 + bin(num).count("0") - 2
```
