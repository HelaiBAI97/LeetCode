# 202. Happy Number

https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/

---

# Description

Write an algorithm to determine if a number `n` is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it **loops endlessly in a cycle** which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process **ends in 1** are happy numbers.

Return True if `n` is a happy number, and False if not.

**Example**:

<pre><code>
<b>Input</b>: 19
<b>Output</b>: True
<b>Explanation</b>:
<MATH>
1^2 + 9^2 = 82
8^2 + 2^2 = 68
6^2 + 8^2 = 100
1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1
</MATH>
</code></pre>

# Solution

## 1. Naive Approach

**Python**
```python
class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
        hist = set()
        while n != 1 and n not in hist:
            hist.add(n)
            nums = 0
            while n:
                nums += (n%10)**2
                n = n // 10
            n = nums
            
        return True if n == 1 else False
```

**Time Complexity** : $O(N)$ N: max loops

**Space Complexity** :$O(N)$
