# 516. Longest Palindromic Subsequence

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-subsequence/

---

# Description

Given a string s, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

**Example 1**:

<pre><code>
<b>Input</b>: "bbbab"
<b>Output</b>: 4
<b>Explanation</b>: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".
</code></pre>

**Example 2**:

<pre><code>
<b>Input</b>: "cbbd"
<b>Output</b>: 2
<b>Explanation</b>: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".
</code></pre>

**Constraints**:

- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.

# Solution

## 1. Dynamic Programming 1

DP[i][j]: length of longest common subsequene of text1[:i] and text2[:j]

Choice: if a character in or out the common subsequence.

If text1[i] == text2[j]: then the character in the common subsequence, DP[i][j] = DP[i-1][j+1] + 2

Else: the two characters not both in the current common subsequence, same as before, check next, DP[i][j] = max(DP[i-1][j], DP[i][j+1])

If i == j: Then max(DP[i-1][j], DP[i][j+1], DP[i-1][j+1]+1)

**Python**
```python
class Solution:
    def longestPalindromeSubseq(self, s: str) -> int:
        DP = [[0 for _ in range(len(s)+1)] for _ in range(len(s)+1)]
        for l in range(1, len(s)+1):
            # l != r
            for r in range(len(s), l, -1):
                if s[l-1] == s[r-1]:
                    DP[l][r-1] = DP[l-1][r] + 2
                else:
                    DP[l][r-1] = max(DP[l-1][r-1], DP[l][r])
            # l == r
            DP[l][l-1] = max(DP[l][l], DP[l-1][l]+1)
        return max([DP[i][i-1] for i in range(1, len(s)+1)])
```

## 2. Dynamic Programming 2

Another method to design DP function:

DP[i][j]: length of longest common subsequene of text1[i:j]

Choice: if a character in or out the common subsequence.

If text1[i] == text2[j]: then the character in the common subsequence, DP[i][j] = DP[i+1][j-1] + 2

Else: the two characters not both in the current common subsequence, same as before, check next, DP[i][j] = max(DP[i+1][j], DP[i][j-1])

Base case DP[i][i] = 1

**Python**
```python
class Solution:
    def longestPalindromeSubseq(self, s: str) -> int:
        DP = [[0 for _ in range(len(s)+1)] for _ in range(len(s)+1)]
        for l in range(1, len(s)+1):
            # l != r
            for r in range(len(s), l, -1):
                if s[l-1] == s[r-1]:
                    DP[l][r-1] = DP[l-1][r] + 2
                else:
                    DP[l][r-1] = max(DP[l-1][r-1], DP[l][r])
            # l == r
            DP[l][l-1] = max(DP[l][l], DP[l-1][l]+1)
        return max([DP[i][i-1] for i in range(1, len(s)+1)])
```
