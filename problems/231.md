<b>Explanation</b>: 2^0 = 1
</code></pre>

**Example 2**:

<pre><code>
<b>Input</b>: 16
<b>Output</b>: true
<b>Explanation</b>: 2^4 = 16
</code></pre>

**Example 3**:

<pre><code>
<b>Input</b>: 218
<b>Output</b>: false
</code></pre>

# Solution

## 1. Divide by 2

If a number n is power of 2, then if we continuesly divide n by 2, we will finally get 1.

**Python**
```python
class Solution:
    def isPowerOfTwo(self, n: int) -> bool:
        while n and not n%2:
            n /= 2
        
        return n == 1
```

**Time Complexity** : $O(\log{N})$

**Space Complexity** :$O(1)$

## 2. Bit Operation - Move One Bit Right

Use bit operation to do the divide by 2 operation, which moves the number one bit right.

**Python**
```python
class Solution:
    def isPowerOfTwo(self, n: int) -> bool:
        while n and not n & 1:
            n >>= 1
        
        return n == 1
```

**Time Complexity** : $O(\log{N})$

**Space Complexity** :$O(1)$

## 3. Bit Operation - n & (n-1) trick

The numbers that power of two have only one 1 in their bit strings. Starting with 1 and follows 0s. Hence, n-1 have bit strings of all 1s with 1 shorter that n. Therefore, we can use n & (n-1) == 0 to check it.

**Python**
```python
class Solution:
    def isPowerOfTwo(self, n: int) -> bool:
        
        return n and not (n & n-1)
```

**Time Complexity** : $O(1)$ ($O(\log{n})$ in terms of bit)

**Space Complexity** :$O(1)$ ($O(n)$ in terms of bit)

## 4. Bit Operation - Bit Count

Recapping that the numbers that power of two have only one 1 in their bit strings. Hence we can simply count 1s.

**Java**
```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
        return n>0 && Integer.bitCount(n) == 1;
    }
}
```
**Time Complexity** : $O(1)$ ($O(\log{n})$ in terms of bit)

**Space Complexity** :$O(1)$
