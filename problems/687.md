# 687. Longest Univalue Path

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-univalue-path/

---

# Description

Given a binary tree, find the length of the longest path where each node in the path has the same value. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

**Example 1**:

**Input**:
<pre><code>
              5
             / \
            4   5
           / \   \
          1   1   5
</code></pre>
**Output**: 2

**Example 2**:

**Input**:
<pre><code>
              1
             / \
            4   5
           / \   \
          4   4   5
</code></pre>
**Output**: 2

# Solution

## 1. Recursion Divide

A valid path should be linked by child-parent connections in the binary tree without any branches.

For each node, there are two types of path: 1. the path go upstream or 2. not. 

We can get the maxLength of left child and right child by recursion.

For the path go upstream, if node.val equals to left or right then return the max_len of the max(leftLen + 1, rightLen + 1).

For the path not go upstream, maintain a global value to record the max_len of the max(max_len, leftUp + rightUp) which is the lenght rooted at current node.

**Python**
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def longestUnivaluePath(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        def subLongestUnivaluePath(root: TreeNode) -> int:
            '''
                Find the longest univalue path of the tree rooted at current node.
                
                Two types of paths:
                1. one path going upwards of number node.val
                2. path not going upwards
                
                The type 1 path will be returned.
                The longest length of type 2 paths will be stored.
            '''
            if not root: return 0
            
            leftLen = subLongestUnivaluePath(root.left)
            rightLen = subLongestUnivaluePath(root.right)
            
            leftUp = rightUp = 0
            if root.left and root.val == root.left.val:   leftUp = leftLen + 1
            if root.right and root.val == root.right.val: rightUp = rightLen + 1
            
            self.maxLength = max(self.maxLength, leftUp + rightUp)
            return max(leftUp, rightUp)
        
        self.maxLength = 0
        subLongestUnivaluePath(root)
        return self.maxLength
```
