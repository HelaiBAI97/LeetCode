# 322. Coin Change

https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/

---

# Description

You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money amount. Write a function to compute the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `-1`.

**Example 1**:

<pre><code>
<b>Input</b>: coins = [1, 2, 5], amount = 11
<b>Output</b>: 3
<b>Explanation</b>: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
</code></pre>

**Example 2**:

<pre><code>
<b>Input</b>: coins = [2], amount = 3
<b>Output</b>: -1
</code></pre>

# Solution

## 1. Recursion with Memory - Top Down

We can split the problem into subproblems. We can get the minimum amount of coins from min(F(amount - coin)).

A memoization table is designed for reduce the complexity.

**Python**
```python
class Solution:
    def coinChange(self, coins: List[int], amount: int) -> int:
        
        def minCoins(coins: List[int], amount: int) -> int:
            if amount == 0: return 0
            if amount in self.count: return self.count[amount]
            coin_num = float('inf')
            for coin in coins:
                if amount - coin >= 0:
                    count = minCoins(coins, amount - coin)
                    coin_num = min(coin_num, count+1)
            self.count[amount] = coin_num
            return coin_num
        
        if amount == 0: return 0
        self.count = {}
        result = minCoins(coins, amount)
        return result if result != float('inf') else -1
```

**Time Complexity** : $O(S*n)$ where $S$ is the amount and $n$ is denomination count (worst $S$). 

**Space Complexity** :$O(S)$

## 2. Dynamic Programming - Bottom Up

With similiar intuition of approach 1, we can infer the large amount from smaller ones.

**Python**
```python
class Solution:
    def coinChange(self, coins: List[int], amount: int) -> int:
        DP = [float('inf')] * (amount+1) # DP[i] min_num of coins to get amount i
        DP[0] = 0
        for i in range(amount+1):
            for j in coins:
                if i - j >= 0:
                    DP[i] = min(DP[i], DP[i-j]+1)
        return DP[-1] if DP[-1] != float('inf') else -1
```

**Time Complexity** : $O(S*n)$

**Space Complexity** :$O(S)$ (can be increased to $O(1)$)

## 3. Greedy Algorithm

We should try largest coins first, then replace the larger coins with smaller ones. The greedy policy could significantly speed up the code in proper situations.

**Python**
```python
class Solution:
    def coinChange(self, coins: List[int], amount: int) -> int:
        coins.sort(reverse = True)
        min_coins = float('inf')

        def count_coins(start_coin, coin_count, remaining_amount):
            nonlocal min_coins

            if remaining_amount == 0:
                min_coins = min(min_coins, coin_count)
                return

            # Iterate from largest coins to smallest coins
            for i in range(start_coin, len(coins)):
                remaining_coin_allowance = min_coins - coin_count
                max_amount_possible = coins[i] * remaining_coin_allowance

                if coins[i] <= remaining_amount and remaining_amount < max_amount_possible:
                    count_coins(i, coin_count + 1, remaining_amount - coins[i])

        count_coins(0, 0, amount)
        return min_coins if min_coins < float('inf') else -1
```

```python
class Solution:

        def DFS(coin_index, remaining_amount, coin_count):
            nonlocal min_coins
            
            # fill the amount with largest coin
            coin = coins[coin_index]
            coin_num = remaining_amount // coin
            coin_count += coin_num
            remaining_amount %= coin
            if remaining_amount == 0: # finish
                min_coins = min(min_coins, coin_count)
                return  
            if coin_index < len(coins) - 1: # else try smaller coins
                DFS(coin_index + 1, remaining_amount, coin_count)
                next_coin = coins[coin_index + 1]
                for _ in range(coin_num): # replace current coins with samller ones
                    remaining_amount += coin
                    coin_count -= 1
                    remaining_coin_allowance = min_coins - coin_count
                    max_amount_possible = next_coin * remaining_coin_allowance
                    if next_coin <= remaining_amount and max_amount_possible >= remaining_amount:
                        DFS(coin_index + 1, remaining_amount, coin_count)
                    else:
                        break
        coins.sort(reverse=True) # descending
        min_coins = float('inf')
        DFS(0, amount, 0)
        return min_coins if min_coins < float('inf') else -1
