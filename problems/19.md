# 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List

https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/

---

# Description

Given a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of list and return its head.

**Example**:

> Given linked list: **1->2->3->4->5**, and **n = 2**.
> 
> After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes **1->2->3->5**.

**Note**:

Given n will always be valid.

# Solution

## 1. Two Pass Algorithm

Count all nodes and remove the n-th node from the end.

**Python**
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: ListNode, n: int) -> ListNode:
        result = head
        length = 0
        
        while head:
            head = head.next
            length += 1
        
        nth = length - n
        result = head
        if nth == 0:
            head = head.next
        else:
            count = 1
            while count < nth:
                head = head.next
                count += 1
            head.next = head.next.next
            
        return result
```

**Time Complexity** : $O(n)$

**Space Complexity** :$O(1)$

## 2. One Pass Algorithm

Maintain the pointer to the n-th node ahead from the current node. 

**Python**
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: ListNode, n: int) -> ListNode:
        
        if not head or not head.next:
            return None
        
        result = nth = head
        count = 0
        while head:
            
            if count == n + 1:
                nth = nth.next
            else:
                count += 1
            
            head = head.next
        
        if n == count:
            result = nth.next
        else:
            nth.next = nth.next.next
        
        return result
```
