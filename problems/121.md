# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/

---

# Description

Say you have an array for which the $i^{\text{th}}$ element is the price of a given stock on day $i$.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

**Example 1**:

<pre><code>
<b>Input</b>: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
<b>Output</b>: 5
<b>Expanation</b>: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying 
</code></pre>

**Example 2**:

<pre><code>
<b>Input</b>: [7,6,4,3,1]
<b>Output</b>: 0
<b>Expanation</b>: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
</code></pre>

# Solution

## 1. Dynamic Programming

State: price of each day. Choice: the day to buy and sell. DP[i]: maximal profit if sell at day i.

**Python**
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        DP = [0] * len(prices)
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            DP[i] = max(0, DP[i-1] + prices[i] - prices[i-1])
        return max(DP) if prices else 0
```

**Time Complexity** : $O(n)$

**Space Complexity** :$O(n)$

## 2. One Pass

According to the fact that the maximal profit comes from the largest gap between current price and lowest price ever before. Hence, by traversing the prices, we can get the minimal price before day i and the price at day i, which results in the profit.

**Python**
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        profit, minCost = 0, math.inf
        for price in prices:
            profit = max(profit, price - minCost)
            minCost = min(minCost, price)
        return profit
```

**Time Complexity** : $O(n)$

**Space Complexity** :$O(1)$
