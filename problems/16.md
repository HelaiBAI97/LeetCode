# 16. 3Sum Closest

https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum-closest/

---

# Description

Given an array `nums` of n integers and an integer `target`, find three integers in `nums` such that the sum is closest to `target`. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

**Example 1**:

> **Input:** nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1
> 
> **Output:** 2
> 
> **Explanation:** The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).

**Constraints**:

- `3 <= nums.length <= 10^3`
- `-10^3 <= nums[i] <= 10^3`
- `-10^4 <= target <= 10^4`

# Solution

Ref: https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum-closest/solution/

## 1. Binary Search

1. Initialize the minimum difference `diff` with a large value.
2. Sort the input array `nums`.
3. Iterate through the array (outer loop):
    - For the current position `i`, iterate through the array starting from `j = i + 1` (inner loop):
        + Binary-search for `complement` (`target - nums[i] - nums[j]`) in the rest of the array.
        + For the next higher value, check its absolute difference with `complement` against `diff`.
        + For the previous lower value, check its absolute difference with `complement` against `diff`.
        + Update `diff` based on the smallest absolute difference.
    - If `diff` is zero, break from the loop.
4. Return the value of the closest triplet, which is `target - diff`.

**Python**
```python
class Solution:
    def threeSumClosest(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        diff = float('inf')
        nums.sort()
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
                complement = target - nums[i] - nums[j]
                hi = bisect_right(nums, complement, j + 1)
                lo = hi - 1
                if hi < len(nums) and abs(complement - nums[hi]) < abs(diff):
                    diff = complement - nums[hi]
                if lo > j and abs(complement - nums[lo]) < abs(diff):
                    diff = complement - nums[lo]
            if diff == 0:
                break
        return target - diff
```

## 2. Two Pointers

**Python**
```python
class Solution:
    def threeSumClosest(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        diff = float('inf')
        nums.sort()
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            lo, hi = i + 1, len(nums) - 1
            while (lo < hi):
                sum = nums[i] + nums[lo] + nums[hi]
                if abs(target - sum) < abs(diff):
                    diff = target - sum
                if sum < target:
                    lo += 1
                else:
                    hi -= 1
            if diff == 0:
                break
        return target - diff
```
