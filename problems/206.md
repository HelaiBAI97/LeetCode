# 206. Reverse Linked List

# Description

Reverse a singly linked list.

**Example**:

<pre><code>
<b>Input</b>: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL
<b>Output</b>: 5->4->3->2->1->NULL
</code></pre>

**Follow up**:

A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?

# Solution

## 1. Recursively

With recursively method, we traverse the node list from tail to head. For each recursion, return the newHead and newTail of result list. Change the newTail's next pointer to the current node and assign the current node as the newTail.

**Python**
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        def helper(head):
            if not head.next: return head, head
            newHead, newTail = helper(head.next)
            newTail.next = head
            return newHead, head
        if not head: return None
        newHead, _ = helper(head)
        head.next = None
        return newHead
```

**Time Complexity** : $O(n)$

**Space Complexity** :$O(n)$
        
## 2. Iteratively

With iteratively method, we traverse the node list from head to tail. Maintain two pointers refer to the newHead and newTail nodes. Change the current node's next to the newHead and assign the current node to newHead.

**Python**
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        newHead, curr = None, head
        while curr:
            next, curr.next = curr.next, newHead
            newHead, curr = curr, next
        return newHead
```

**Time Complexity** : $O(n)$

**Space Complexity** :$O(1)$
