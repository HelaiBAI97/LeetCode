# 25. Reverse Nodes in k-Group

https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/

---

# Description

Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list $k$ at a time and return its modified list.

$k$ is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of $k$ then left-out nodes in the end should remain as it is.

**Example**:

Given this linked list: `1->2->3->4->5`

For $k = 2$, you should return: `2->1->4->3->5`

For $k = 3$, you should return: `3->2->1->4->5`

**Note**:

- Only constant extra memory is allowed.
- You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.

# Solution

## 1. Naive Approach

**Python**
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverseKGroup(self, head: ListNode, k: int) -> ListNode:
        K_Group = []
        result = pointer = ListNode()
        pointer.next = head
        while head:
            K_Group.append(head)
            if len(K_Group) == k:
                next = head.next
                for i in range(k-1,-1,-1):
                    pointer.next = K_Group[i]
                    pointer = pointer.next
                pointer.next = next
                head = pointer
                K_Group = []
            
            head = head.next
            
        return result.next
```

**Time Complexity** : $O(n)$

**Space Complexity** :$O(1)$
