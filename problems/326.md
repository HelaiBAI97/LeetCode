# Solution

## 1. Iteratly Divide by 3

If a number is the power of three, then it is the result of multiply of multiple 3s.

**Python**
```python
class Solution:
    def isPowerOfThree(self, n: int) -> bool:
        # divide by 3
        while n > 1:
            n /= 3
        return n == 1
```

**Time Complexity** : $O(\log_{3}{n})$

**Space Complexity** :$O(1)$

## 2. Base Conversion

Ref: https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-three/solution/

If a number is the power of three, then its representation with base 3 is '1' followed by '0's. Use n&(n-1) to check.

**Java**
```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfThree(int n) {
        return Integer.toString(n, 3).matches("^10*$");
    }
}
```

**Time Complexity** : $O(\log_{3}{n})$

**Space Complexity** :$O(1)$

## 3. Mathematics

Ref: https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-three/solution/

We can use mathematics as follows

$n = 3^i \\ i = \log_3(n) \\ i = \frac{\log_b(n)}{\log_b(3)}$

$n$ is a power of three if and only if $i$ is an integer. In Java, we check if a number is an integer by taking the decimal part (using `% 1`) and checking if it is `0`. 

**Java 1**
```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfThree(int n) {
        return (Math.log10(n) / Math.log10(3)) % 1 == 0;
    }
}
```

However, this solution is problematic because we start using double `s`, which means we are subject to precision errors. This means, we should never use `==` when comparing doubles. That is because the result of `Math.log10(n) / Math.log10(3)` could be `5.0000001` or `4.9999999`. This effect can be observed by using the function `Math.log()` instead of `Math.log10()`.

In order to fix that, we need to compare the result against an `epsilon`.

**Java 2**
```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfThree(int n) {
        return (Math.log(n) / Math.log(3) + epsilon) % 1 <= 2 * epsilon;
    }
}
```

**Time Complexity** : Complexity of `Math.log`, which is dependent on the language we are using and the compiler.

**Space Complexity** :$O(1)$

## 4. Integer Limitations

Ref: https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-three/solution/

In particular, `n` is of type `int`. In Java, this means it is a 4 byte, signed integer. The maximum value of this data type is `2147483647`. The online judging system nomarlly use this as the `MAXINT` value.

Hence we can calculate the largest number of the power of three which should be `3n` times bigger of the given number. 

The maximum value can be calculate by:

$$3^{\lfloor{}\log_3{MaxInt}\rfloor{}} = 3^{\lfloor{}19.56\rfloor{}} = 3^{19} = 1162261467$$

**Python**
```python
class Solution:
    def isPowerOfThree(self, n: int) -> bool:
        # largest % = 0
        import math
        largest_power_of_three = 3**math.floor(math.log((2**32)/2, 3))
        return n > 0 and not largest_power_of_three % n
```

**Time Complexity** : $O(1)$

**Space Complexity** :$O(1)$
