# 11. Container With Most Water

---

# Description

Given $n$ non-negative integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$, where each represents a point at coordinate $(i, a_i)$. $n$ vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line $i$ is at $(i, a_i)$ and $(i, 0)$. Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

**Note**: You may not slant the container and $n$ is at least 2.

<font size=1>The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.</font>

**Example**:

> **Input**: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]

# Solution

## 1. Brute Force

ref: https://leetcode.com/problems/regular-expression-matching/solution/

We can simply find all possible containers and calculate their volumns.

**Python**
```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        
        max_area  = 0
        for i in range(len(height)-1):
            for j in range(i+1, len(height)):
                max_area = max(max_area, (j-i)*min(height[i],height[j]))
        return max_area

```

**Time Complexity** : $O(n^2)$

**Space Complexity** : $O(1)$

## 2. Two Pointer

Based on the intuition that the area formed between lines are limited by the height of the shorter line, hence we could try to increase the shorter line to get larger area. 

Simple proof: Denote an area with lines $(l, r)$. WLOG(Without lost of ge), If $l<r$, then this area is the largest area that boundaries in $[l,r]$. Hence, we can ignore any other right boundaries less than $r$. Next is $(l+1, r)$.

**Python**
```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        
        l, r = 0, len(height)-1
        max_area = (r-l)*min(height[l],height[r])
        
        while l<r:
            max_area = max(max_area, (r-l)*min(height[l],height[r]))
            
            if (height[l]<height[r]):
                l+=1
            else:
                r-=1
                        
        return max_area
```

**Time Complexity** : $O(n)$

**Space Complexity** : $O(1)$

Faster one:

**Python**
```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        
        l, r = 0, len(height)-1
        max_area = 0
        
        while l<r:
            hl,hr = height[l],height[r]
            if (height[l]<height[r]):
                area = (r-l)*height[l]
                while height[l]<=hl and l<r:
                    l += 1
            else:
                area = (r-l)*height[r]
                while height[r]<=hr and l<r:
                    r -= 1
            max_area = max(max_area, area)
        return max_area
```
